    docs/context-engineering.md:When humans solve tasks, we take notes and remember things for future, related tasks. Agents are also gaining
    these capabilities! Note-taking via a “[scratchpad](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool?ref=blog.langchain.com)” is one
    approach to persist information while an agent is performing a task. The idea is to save information outside of the context window so that
    it’s available to the agent. [Anthropic’s multi-agent
    researcher](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system?ref=blog.langchain.com) illustrates a clear example of
    this:
    docs/context-engineering.md:Scratchpads can be implemented in a few different ways. They can be a [tool
    call](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool?ref=blog.langchain.com) that simply [writes to a
    file](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem?ref=blog.langchain.com). They can also be a field in a
    runtime [state object](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/?ref=blog.langchain.com#state) that persists during the
    session. In either case, scratchpads let agents save useful information to help them accomplish a task.
    docs/context-engineering.md:The mechanism for selecting context from a scratchpad depends upon how the scratchpad is implemented. If it’s a
    [tool](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool?ref=blog.langchain.com), then an agent can simply read it by making a tool
    call. If it’s part of the agent’s runtime state, then the developer can choose what parts of state to expose to an agent each step. This
    provides a fine-grained level of control for exposing scratchpad context to the LLM at later turns.
    docs/context-engineering.md:LangGraph was designed with both thread-scoped
    ([short-term](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#short-term-memory)) and [long-term
    memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#long-term-memory). Short-term memory uses
    [checkpointing](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/?ref=blog.langchain.com) to persist [agent
    state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/?ref=blog.langchain.com#state) across all steps of an agent. This is
    extremely useful as a “scratchpad”, allowing you to write information to state and fetch it at any step in your agent trajectory.

Here's an example run-through demonstrating both internal tools:

    1. Used the TODO list tool


        * Added tasks to look for scratchpad and todo_list usage, then to summarize.

        * Marked each task as started/completed, showing basic workflow management.
    2. Used the scratchpad tool


        * Wrote notes capturing the ripgrep search results for each tool.

        * Added a final consolidated summary.

Key findings captured in the scratchpad:

• scratchpad tool: only mentioned in documentation and a single test; no active runtime implementation.
• todo_list tool: fully implemented and wired up (src/utils/todo-list-tool.ts, tool-selection.ts, agent-loop.ts).

This illustrates how the built-in scratchpad and TODO list utilities can be combined for lightweight analysis and note-keeping while exploring
the codebase.
